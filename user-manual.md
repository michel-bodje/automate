## Overview

The Allen Madelin Office Add-In (Automate) is designed to streamline common tasks for the law firm. It integrates directly into Office (Outlook and Word), allowing users to perform these tasks efficiently without leaving their email client. The add-in dynamically adapts its menu options based on the context:

- **Draft Email Message**: Displays only email-related options.
- **Draft Appointment**: Displays only the scheduling option.
- **Word Document**: Displays only the contract-making option.

Additionally, the add-in now supports two scheduling modes: **Auto** (default) and **Manual**.

This manual is divided into two sections:
1. **User Workflow**: Instructions for using the add-in to schedule appointments and draft emails.
2. **Developer Guide**: A detailed explanation of the codebase to help future developers maintain and extend the add-in.

## Developer Guide

### Codebase Overview

The add-in is built using JavaScript and integrates with the Office JavaScript API. The codebase is modular, with each module handling a specific aspect of the add-in's functionality.

The source code is hosted on Github at [https://github.com/michel-bodje/automate.git](https://github.com/michel-bodje/automate.git).

The add-in manifest files point to the Github Pages URL at [https://michel-bodje.github.io/automate](https://michel-bodje.github.io/automate), but it is not recommended to open in a browser as the app breaks outside of Office.

#### Key Files and Directories
- **`app/`**: Contains the main application logic.
  - **`taskpane.html`**: The main UI for the add-in.
  - **`taskpane.js`**: Handles user interactions and orchestrates the workflow.
  - **`modules/`**: Contains reusable modules for specific functionalities.
    - **`auth.js`**: Handles authentication with Microsoft services.
    - **`graph.js`**: Interacts with the Microsoft Graph API to fetch calendar events.
    - **`compose.js`**: Manages email drafting.
    - **`lawyer.js`**: Manages lawyer data and operations.
    - **`rules.js`**: Implements business rules for scheduling.
    - **`state.js`**: Manages the form state.
    - **`ui.js`**: Handles UI interactions and updates.
    - **`util.js`**: Contains utility functions for validation and formatting.
    - **`timeUtils.js`**: Provides time-related utilities for scheduling.
- **`assets/templates/`**: Stores email and docx templates in English and French.
- **`manifests/`**: Defines the add-in's metadata and configuration for Outlook and Word.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Configures the build process.
- **`package.json`**: Configures the build scripts.

#### Workflow Explanation
1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user interacts with the UI in `taskpane.html`.
   - Events are handled in `taskpane.js`, which updates the `formState` object and triggers the appropriate actions.

<br>

*Most dropdowns are dynamically generated. Other fields only become visible conditionally.*

</div>
<br>

2. **Scheduling Appointments**:
   - The `scheduleAppointment` function in `taskpane.js`:
     - Validates inputs using `util.js`.
     - Fetches the lawyer's calendar events via `graph.js`.
     - Generates available time slots using `rules.js` and `timeUtils.js`.
     - Creates a meeting using `compose.js`.

3. **Drafting Emails**:
   - The `createEmail` function in `compose.js`:
     - Retrieves the appropriate email template from `templates.js`.
     - Replaces placeholders with dynamic data from `formState`.
     - Sets the email subject, body, and recipients using the Office JavaScript API.

<br>

*In `compose.js`, the `createEmail` and `createMeeting` functions are the basis of this add-in.*

</div>
<br>

4. **Authentication**:
   - The `auth.js` module initializes the MSAL library for authentication.
   - Access tokens are acquired to interact with the Microsoft Graph API.

5. **Calendar Integration**:
   - The `graph.js` module fetches and manages calendar events using the Microsoft Graph API.

6. **Business Rules**:
   - The `rules.js` module enforces rules for scheduling, such as avoiding lunch breaks and respecting daily appointment limits.

7. **Dynamic Menus**:
   - Implemented in `taskpane.js` to adapt options based on context.

8. **Scheduling Modes**:
   - Added in `taskpane.js` and `ui.js` to support Auto and Manual modes. 

#### Extending Functionality
- **Adding a New Email Template**:
  1. Create a new HTML file in the `assets/templates/` directory.
  2. Use placeholders in the same format as existing templates (e.g., `${clientName}`, `${date}`) to ensure dynamic data can be inserted.
  3. Add the template to `templates.js` under the appropriate language.
  4. Update `compose.js` to handle the new template type.
  5. Test the new template by selecting the corresponding email type in the add-in and verifying the generated draft email.

- **Adding a New Word Template**:
  1. Create a new `.docx` template file and save it in the `assets/templates/` directory.
  2. Use placeholders in the same format as existing templates (e.g., `{{clientName}}`, `{{clientEmail}}`) to ensure dynamic data can be inserted.
  3. Update `templates.js` to include the new template under the appropriate language and category.
  4. Modify `compose.js` to handle the new template type when generating Word documents.
  5. Test the new template by selecting **Create Contract** in Word and verifying the output.

- **Adding a New Case Type**:
  1. Update `lawyerData.json` to include the new case type for relevant lawyers.
  2. Add a handler for the case type in `util.js`.
  3. Update `taskpane.html` to include any additional fields required for the case type.

- **Modifying Business Rules**:
  - Update the `rules.js` module to implement new rules or modify existing ones.

#### Debugging and Testing
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` before starting the server.

- To run the add-in locally, use the following npm scripts:
    1. Start the development server: `npm start`.
    This will launch both Outlook and Word for concurrent debugging.  
    2. Stop the development server: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running, or use `npm stop`.

- The `webpack.config.js` file is already configured to handle differences between development and production environments. To test the production build:
    1. Run `npm run build` to generate the production files.
    2. Access the production version of the add-in via Outlook logged to [admin@amlex.ca](mailto:admin@amlex.ca).

- Test the add-in in both development and production environments to ensure compatibility.
