## Developer Guide

### Codebase Overview

The add-in is built using JavaScript and integrates with the Office JavaScript API. The codebase is modular, with each module handling a specific aspect of the add-in's functionality.

The source code is hosted on Github at [https://github.com/michel-bodje/automate.git](https://github.com/michel-bodje/automate.git).

The add-in manifest points to its Github Pages URL at [https://michel-bodje.github.io/automate](https://michel-bodje.github.io/automate), but it is not recommended to open in a browser as the app breaks outside of Outlook.

#### Key Files and Directories
- **`app/`**: Contains the main application logic.
  - **`taskpane.html`**: The main UI for the add-in.
  - **`taskpane.js`**: Handles user interactions and orchestrates the workflow.
  - **`modules/`**: Contains reusable modules for specific functionalities.
    - **`auth.js`**: Handles authentication with Microsoft services.
    - **`graph.js`**: Interacts with the Microsoft Graph API to fetch calendar events.
    - **`compose.js`**: Manages email drafting.
    - **`lawyer.js`**: Manages lawyer data and operations.
    - **`rules.js`**: Implements business rules for scheduling.
    - **`state.js`**: Manages the form state.
    - **`ui.js`**: Handles UI interactions and updates.
    - **`util.js`**: Contains utility functions for validation and formatting.
    - **`timeUtils.js`**: Provides time-related utilities for scheduling.
  - **`templates/`**: Stores email templates in English and French.
- **`manifest.xml`**: Defines the add-in's metadata and configuration.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Configures the build process.

#### Workflow Explanation
1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user interacts with the UI in `taskpane.html`.
   - Events are handled in `taskpane.js`, which updates the `formState` object and triggers the appropriate actions.

<br>

*Most dropdowns are dynamically generated. Other fields only become visible conditionally.*

</div>
<br>

2. **Scheduling Appointments**:
   - The `scheduleAppointment` function in `taskpane.js`:
     - Validates inputs using `util.js`.
     - Fetches the lawyer's calendar events via `graph.js`.
     - Generates available time slots using `rules.js` and `timeUtils.js`.
     - Creates a meeting using `compose.js`.

3. **Drafting Emails**:
   - The `createEmail` function in `compose.js`:
     - Retrieves the appropriate email template from `templates.js`.
     - Replaces placeholders with dynamic data from `formState`.
     - Sets the email subject, body, and recipients using the Office JavaScript API.

<br>

*In `compose.js`, the `createEmail` and `createMeeting` functions are the basis of this add-in.*

<br>

4. **Authentication**:
   - The `auth.js` module initializes the MSAL library for authentication.
   - Access tokens are acquired to interact with the Microsoft Graph API.

5. **Calendar Integration**:
   - The `graph.js` module fetches and manages calendar events using the Microsoft Graph API.

6. **Business Rules**:
   - The `rules.js` module enforces rules for scheduling, such as avoiding lunch breaks and respecting daily appointment limits.

#### Extending Functionality
- **Adding a New Email Template**:
  1. Create a new HTML file in the `templates/` directory.
  2. Add the template to `templates.js` under the appropriate language.
  3. Update `compose.js` to handle the new template type.

- **Adding a New Case Type**:
  1. Update `lawyerData.json` to include the new case type for relevant lawyers.
  2. Add a handler for the case type in `util.js`.
  3. Update `taskpane.html` to include any additional fields required for the case type.

- **Modifying Business Rules**:
  - Update the `rules.js` module to implement new rules or modify existing ones.

- **Modifying Business Rules**:
  - Update the `rules.js` module to implement new rules or modify existing ones.

#### Debugging and Testing
- To run the add-in locally, use the following npm scripts:
    1. Start the development server: `npm start`
    2. Stop the development server: Press `npm stop`.
    
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` before starting the server.
- Use `npm run lint` to check for code quality issues.
- Test the add-in in both development and production environments to ensure compatibility.

- The `webpack.config.js` file is already configured to handle differences between development and production environments. To test the production build:
    1. Run `npm run build` to generate the production files.
    2. Access the production version of the add-in via Outlook logged to [admin@amlex.ca](mailto:admin@amlex.ca).
